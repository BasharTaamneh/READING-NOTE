#  Mongo and Mongoose

SQL databases are relational, NoSQL databases are non-relational. SQL databases use structured query language and have a predefined schema. NoSQL databases have dynamic schemas for unstructured data. SQL databases are vertically scalable, while NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable.



## What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?
1 – Type of Data
If your data is highly structured and associations among the program entities are clearly defined (for instance, if you are developing a point of sale system where you need to store customer orders and product records), conventional SQL based databases are the best fit.

## Give a real world example.


The real world is the place in which one actually must live and the circumstances with which one actually must deal. An example of the real world is the life you are living right now, as opposed to the life you wish to live some day.


## What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?

if your application requires high availability and scalability, a NoSQL Database built on BASE properties might be suitable. Choose NoSQL if you have or need: Semi-structured or Unstructured data / flexible schema. Limited pre-defined access paths and query patterns.

## Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?

Document based database like MongoDB, and Redis are great for small scale, hierarchical data with a relatively small amount of children for each entry.

## Which type of database is best for scalability?

 First of all, MySQL, MSSQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, all are highly scalable, it's just that they require little maintenance for it. All SQL based databases are very stable, and are in production since years.


 ## What does SQL stand for?

 
Structured Query Language
SQL (pronounced "ess-que-el") stands for Structured Query Language. SQL is used to communicate with a database. According to ANSI (American National Standards Institute), it is the standard language for relational database management systems.

## What is a realational database?

A relational database is a type of database that stores and provides access to data points that are related to one another. 

## What type of structure does a relational database work with?


The relational model means that the logical data structures—the data tables, views, and indexes—are separate from the physical storage structures. This separation means that database administrators can manage physical data storage without affecting access to that data as a logical structure.

## What is a ‘schema’?

The database schema is its structure described in a formal language supported by the database management system (DBMS). The term "schema" refers to the organization of data as a blueprint of how the database is constructed (divided into database tables in the case of relational databases). The formal definition of a database schema is a set of formulas (sentences) called integrity constraints imposed on a database.[citation needed] These integrity constraints ensure compatibility between parts of the schema. All constraints are expressible in the same language. A database can be considered a structure in realization of the database language.The states of a created conceptual schema are transformed into an explicit mapping, the database schema. This describes how real-world entities are modeled in the database.

## What is a NoSQL database?

 NoSQL databases (aka "not only SQL") are non tabular, and store data differently than relational tables. NoSQL databases come in a variety of types based on their data model. The main types are document, key-value, wide-column, and graph. They provide flexible schemas and scale easily with large amounts of data and high user loads.
