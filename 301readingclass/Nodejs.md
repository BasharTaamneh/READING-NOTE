# An Introduction to Node.js

## What is node.js?
Node.js® is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome’s V8 JavaScript engine.
And this is what Stack Overflow has to offer:
Node.js is an event-based, non-blocking, asynchronous I/O runtime that uses Google’s V8 JavaScript engine and libuv library.

##  what is Chrome’s V8 JavaScript Engine?

V8 is Google’s open-source high-performance JavaScript and WebAssembly engine, written in C++. It is used in Chrome and in Node.js, among others. It implements ECMAScript and WebAssembly, and runs on Windows 7 or later, macOS 10.12+, and Linux systems that use x64, IA-32, ARM, or MIPS processors. V8 can run standalone or can be embedded into any C++ application.

## What does it mean that node is a JavaScript runtime?


Node. js is a JavaScript runtime environment that achieves low latency and high throughput by taking a “non-blocking” approach to serving requests. In other words, Node. js wastes no time or resources on waiting for I/O requests to return.


## What is npm?

npm is two things: first and foremost, it is an online repository for the publishing of open-source Node.js projects; second, it is a command-line utility for interacting with a said repository that aids in package installation, version management, and dependency management. A plethora of Node.js libraries and applications are published on npm, and many more are added every day.

**What command would you type to install a library/package called ‘jshint’?**  run the command npm install jshint in CLI. If you want to check if JSHint has been successfully installed, run the command jshint -version to see its version.

**What is node used for?** Node. js is primarily used for non-blocking, event-driven servers, due to its single-threaded nature. It's used for traditional web sites and back-end API services, but was designed with real-time, push-based architectures in mind.

## How does pair programming work?

pair programming is an agile software development technique in which two programmers work together at one workstation. One, the driver, writes code while the other, the observer or navigator, reviews each line of code as it is typed in. The two programmers switch roles frequently.
