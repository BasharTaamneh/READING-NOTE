## What is CSS?

 CSS is the language we use to style an HTML document, CSS describes how HTML elements should be displayed.


### **What is CSS exactly for?**

Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML. ... CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts.

### **CSS syntax**

A CSS rule consists of a selector and a declaration block.

The selector points to the HTML element you want to style.

The declaration block contains one or more declarations separated by semicolons.

Each declaration includes a CSS property name and a value, separated by a colon.

Multiple CSS declarations are separated with semicolons, and declaration blocks are surrounded by curly braces.


*Example:*

    p {
    color: red;
    text-align: center;
    }


*Example Explained*


- p is a selector in CSS (it points to the HTML element you want to style: <p>).
- color is a property, and red is the property value
- text-align is a property, and center is the property value

When a browser reads a style sheet, it will format the HTML document according to the information in the style sheet.
