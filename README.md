## *What is a growth mindset?*
A growth mindset is when students understand that their abilities can be developed,People are born with unique genetic structures, meaning they are initially better than others at different things. However, those with a growth mindset believe that one can always improve, catch up, or even surpass others’ natural talents. 
This is where teachers play a crucial role in shaping a student’s confidence and outlook on school through productive, continuous feedback. 
that as humans, we operate in both a fixed and growth mindset, Most humans have a fixed mindset about jumping (unaided) off a cliff. 
 No amount of belief in your ability to fly; no amount of “hard word and practice” (e.g. jumping off a stair, a table, etc.) will prepare you to fly.
 Knowing that you cannot fly and that no amount of work will change your ability to fly, is a normal, appropriate (life-saving) fixed mindset.
 
 * Fixed Mindset: “In a fixed mindset, people believe that their primary qualities, such as their intelligence or talent, are simply fixed traits. They spend their time documenting their intelligence or talents rather than developing them. They also believe that only talent makes success—without effort.

* Growth Mindset: “In a growth mindset, people believe that their core abilities can be developed through dedication and hard work - brains and talents are just the starting point. This view creates a love of learning and the flexibility that is essential to great achievement.
